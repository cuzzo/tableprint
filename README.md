tableprint
==========

Pretty print sql-like tables--because, duh!

Usage
=====

tableprint has one usage: to pretty-print a sql-like table... sql style.

Why is this helpful?  If you have a list of instances (or tables) that are all of similar structure and one (or multiple) of the instances is behaving strangely, it can be really convenient to be able to quickly (and prettifully) print that list--not to mention, it can suffice for reporting.

Installation
============

Copy tableprint.lua to your working repository / directory or anywhere in your ```package.path``` (preferably your lib directory).  Then, to use tableprint in your program, just include:

```lua
require 'tableprint'
```

License
=======

tableprint is free--as in BSD.  Hack your heart out, hackers.
